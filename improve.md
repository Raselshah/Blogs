<h2>You Will Never Improve In Your Coding Career If You Do This.</h2></br>
It's a great achievement for aspiring web developers to become a Coding Maniac through their journey of learning how to code. But there are some certain things that most people are doing that hinder the effectiveness of learning how to code in a negative way. Many of them would think that they are improving, but unfortunately they aren't because of some certain things they are doing which is going to be listed below.</br>

#1. Learning Many Programming Languages.</br>
This is a bad practice which everyone should take into consideration by avoiding it as better as you can. Many web developers love to know all these programming languages, but jumping into it by learning everything at the same time would not help you to improve in anything. The best thing you can do is to pick one programming language and start from that. As time goes on, you can choose another one when you get better at the previous one and start learning it as well. By doing all that, you're taking a gradual process towards achieving your goals. You don't have to burden yourself with everything and end up with zero achievement which is very devastating to hearing.</br>

#2. Not Starting From The Basics.</br>
When you watch some cool videos of another Developers on YouTube and you see some cool things which they have built, you feel extremely interested in doing the same right ? but if you jump into it by watching the same video and building the same thing without knowing the concept, you will not improve in your coding career. All you need to do is to start with the Basics and that's all. As time goes on, you will know the concept and you will be able to build whatever you want to build. Consistency and dedication in learning how to code will enable you achieve something great in no time.</br>

#3. Lack Of Consistency.

This is one of the greatest factor which could affect your improvement in your coding career. Consistency and a lot of practice are the keys toward becoming a better web developer, but when all these things are neglected, trust me, you're just roaming around a doughnut which will lead you to nowhere else and you will get stucked in one place without any improvement. Even if it's 1 hour you can sacrifice to study and practice on how to get better in coding, then Do It. It's going to help you a lot and it's better than not doing anything at all.</br>

#4. Don't Run away from Code, Run The Code</br>

Of course you will face a lot of challenges towards becoming a good web developers, but running away from code won't help you to solve any problem. In another case, it's affecting you without even noticing the effect it has. Web developers should be problem solvers, but running away from it shows that you're a coward and that will not help you to get better. Rather, find a way to make it happen and get the code running instead of running away from Code.</br>

In conclusion, if you take all this into consideration, you will get better in no time. And don't forget to like and share to your friends and loved ones who are struggling to become a good web developer.</br>
